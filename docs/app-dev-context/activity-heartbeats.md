An Activity Heartbeat is a ping from the Worker that is executing the Activity to the Temporal Cluster.
Each Heartbeat informs the Temporal Cluster that the Activity Execution is making progress and the Worker has not crashed.
If the Cluster does not receive a Heartbeat within a [Heartbeat Timeout](/concepts/what-is-a-heartbeat-timeout) time period, the Activity will be considered failed and another [Activity Task Execution](/concepts/what-is-an-activity-task-execution) may be scheduled according to the Retry Policy.

Heartbeats may not always be sent to the Clusterâ€”they may be throttled by the Worker.
The throttle interval is the smaller of:

- `if heartbeatTimeout is provided, heartbeatTimeout * 0.8; else defaultHeartbeatThrottleInterval`
- `maxHeartbeatThrottleInterval`

`defaultHeartbeatThrottleInterval` is 30 seconds by default, and `maxHeartbeatThrottleInterval` is 60 seconds by default.
Each can be set in Worker options.

If an Activity is Cancelled, it will receive the Cancellation request when the next heartbeat is sent to the Cluster.

Heartbeats may contain a `details` field describing the Activity's current progress. If an Activity gets retried, the Activity can access the `details` from the last heartbeat that was sent to the Cluster.
